"Community" is a word often used in the software development
industry. It is commonly used in arguments about tools or
technologies - particularly in decision-making contexts. The following
might be a familiar conversation to many:

> Person 1: "Tool A has a much better community than B."
> Person 2: "I disagree. The B community is much friendlier than A."

What qualifies a community as "better" or "friendlier?" What are we
really talking about here?

What A or B mean in this example is irrelevant to the underlying
meaning - or lack thereof - of the concept of "community."  We seem to
use it without a specific definition and much less with a shared,
agreed-upon semantic understanding.

According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary a community is "a unified
body of individuals." What they share in common can be many things:
characteristics, interests, politics, and even geographic or policy
commonalities."

In this article I explore some of the common meanings that we employ
around the word "community" in the industry but rarely take the time
to be explicit about.

## Availability of people

The simplest of the definitions is the size of a certain community. If
a million people use A and just ten thousand use B this is an easy
numerical comparison.

Or is it? There are a few complications when taking the size of a
community to any argument.

For starters, the very number representing the size of a community is
at best an estimate. There are indirect ways to infer the size of a
community (i.e. scrapping public GitHub repos and calculating the
amount of repos that use language X vs language Y). In fact, we often
go into time-consuming arguments about the best sources or the best
ways to infer community sizes. In particular, each method carries its
own set of biases, making it hard for most to emotionally disconnect
(i.e. scrapping public GitHub repos might numerically privilege
languages used mostly for open source or, in fact, communities that
tend to fork more often - whether these are good or bad biases spawns
all sorts of arguments by themselves).

If calculating the size of a community is hard, the kind of people
composes a community is even harder - or at least a lot more
nuanced. What does your team or business need in terms of the kind of
people it attracts? Is a technology with a million people whose
professional experience is minimal better than one with a few thousand
people who are at very senior end of the spectrum? What are the
implications of these choices from a business and cost perspective?

## Availability of material

TBD: the stackoverflow example - kind of connected with the first
one - the more people, the more material - but not necesasarily
depending on the kind of people

TBD: Kind of material - mix of the kind of people with the
availability of material - certain people consume/produce content
differently and this will affect the "community"

## Shared values

TBD: OOP values... FP values... social values... or simply because
company X uses it and we want to be the next X.

## Future trends

TBD: younger people, scientists, vangard companies... they might all
be pointing towards the future - but which one is right? Part of
"community" is also embracing a certain vision of a future.

## Collaboration

TBD: according to merriam-webster a "joint ownership or participation"
the ability/drive to collaborate back - to share the ownership and get
engaged in participating

TBD: some "communities" are more accepting to newcomers than
others. Some might be more meritocratic while others are popularity
contests. Is this a variable that matters to you and your team?

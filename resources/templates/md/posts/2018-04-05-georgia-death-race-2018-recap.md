It's been a while that I don't write a race recap. Very few races deserve one and the Georgia Death Race (GDR) sure falls within that category. Sean XXX organizes a hell of a race. The 2018 GDR was the 6th edition of the gorgeous and challenging showcase of the Northern Georgia mountains.

## The race

Everything about this race is absolutely impeccable. Sean even prepares a 20+ minute video detailing everything you need to know before the race. The bibs are uniquely shaped like coffins - a nice touch. Bib pick up itself is a blast. The volunteers diligently check all the mandatory gear in a lodge overlooking breath-taking views of Amicolola Park. There were mariachis for entertainment and more of Sean walking us through the operational details.

The trail was beautful. The first 13 miles had the hardest and steepest climbs but also provided fantastic views. One can't help but stop and gasp for a few minutes at the top of every mountain at the sun raising behind the mountains on the East, beautiful cold montains on the West, and plenty of foggy valleys in-between. Unforgatable.


## The race for me

Training for the GDR was unfortunately not very high on my priority list for the last 3 months. I had been putting as many climbing hours as a could but I knew fair well that those were nowhere near what I needed for the 15,000+ ft of climbs of the course. On top of that, I didn't have enough sleep the night before the race and the little I had was very agitatedd. I was unable to disconnect from work and ended up messing up my sleeping game. After a very important lesson last year at the Devil Dog 100 with sleep depravation I really didn't want to repeat the same mistakes this time around.

I started the race a bit nervous but, as usual, completely optimistic and cheerful. I'm doing what I love, so enjoying is the main keyword despite the challenges. Sabrina joined me for an early start. The early start takes you away from qualifying the Western States but, in exchange, gives you one extra hour to complete the course. Considering my situation, any extra help was very welcome.

Sabrina and I had a comfortable pace for the first few miles but my body was asking for a bit more. I was struggling with keeping my temperature in the right range and the hours and hours of monotonous and repetitve StairMaster at the gym had me at a complete different pace for the climbs. So I picked up pace and disconnected from Sabrina a bit before the fist aid-station. I was in a good place.

That good place lasted for about 4 miles only. At mile 8 I had to slow down. I started overheating and hydration was off for some reason. This was too soon for trouble. For 13 miles I struggled to eat, felt very dry, lost precision in my movements, and had some minor cramps that were just not supposed to be there.

I had the fantastic views of the Northern Georgia mountains to give me company during this low though. The trail is just beautful. This first section has the hardest and steepest climbs but also provides fantastic views. I couldn't help but stop and gasp for a few minutes at the top of every climb at the beauty of the sun raising behind the mountains on the East, beautiful cold montains on the West, and plenty of foggy valleys in-between. Just unforgatable.

By mile 21.5 I would meet my family. I would also have clocked 7,000+ ft of elevation gain - more than 50% of the course's total gain. I was glad to get at Skeenah Gap in one piece. I had the chance of saying hi to Sabrina when I was coming in. She had passed me several miles before and was just leaving when I got there. It was a short break for me though. I knew I was in a bad place so I couldn't linger at that station for long or it would be pretty hard to go back out there.

I left Fabiana and Ian behind knowing I was in "survival mode." My usual fueling and hydration strategies were not working. My body kept rejecting what I eat or drank. My temperature was all off too. Either too cold or too hot - never right. My body was off and the usual struggle reserved for the later phases of such a long race were all happening way too soon. I got worried because if I was in such a rut so early in the race (only 6:30 hours in) what would be of me on the late 20+ hours? Having thouse thoughts was not helpful as they brought my mental state down even further. All in all, I was a broken machine, feeding on itself, on a collision course to disaster.

In ultra-running we learn to "embrace the suck" and that life sucks. It was either embracing the suck or giving up - and giving up was not an option. The thought of running until I collapsed and only then being pulled out actually gave me hope. At least I wouldn't give up.

I took stock of my predicment and started tuning what I could. For fueling I dropped my usual "mostly Clif Bloks" and changed to "whatever would stay in for a few minutes." For hydration I changed my usual "Fizz-spiked water" to "old-school water, pickle juice and plenty of ginger ale." For temperature I decided to brave the frigid winds without my windbreaker. The windbreaker was not only only partially efficient breaking the winds, it was also keeping me wet under it which dropped my temperature during the cold, shadowy sections and overheated me during the sunny climbs.

I can't really say that this strategy worked 100% because I was constantly low on energy. On top of that I kept worrying about the time. In retrospect I shouldn't be because I was on a good pace. Something just kept nagging in the back of my mind and I couldn't get rid of it. At least I kept moving forward and the beautful sunny day combined with so many encounters with nice runners made the journey to the next station where my family would be surprisingly bearable.

Winding Stairs at mile 43 approached like a mirage. I knew I could afford a short break there and having my family and friends to help me out is always one of the best feelings in the universe. I gave my status to the team, did the routine checks, and tried the new thing I was eager to try - brushing my teeth - that was absolutely great. My pacer Neil provided some stomach medicine to see if I could start eating properly.

We left the station in good spirits. Things were not so bad - relatevely speaking and now we had "just" 30 miles ahead of us. Neil kept telling me they would be the easiest miles and I decided to accept. We got to Jake Bull in an instant and, oh boy, it was so good to eat properly for the first time. It's crazy to think that it was only at mile 52 that my body accepted food - I had noodles, broth, bacon, potatoes, grilled cheese, and probably something more. I just wanted all the food.

Jake Bull to Nimbleweed is where souls are lost in this course. It's easy to understand why. The course is boring and it's the longest stretch without aid stations (11 miles). There are actually a few miles of a real asphalt road and many many many miles of a never ending service road in a somewhat constant and annoying climbing angle.

Neil came up with the craziest strategy at mile 54: "why don't we do tabata intervals?" Yes. You read it right. He wanted to do 1 minute of running and 30 seconds of jogging. At mile 54! And I said "why not?"

It was one of the craziest rides of my life. We overtook 10, 20, 30, easily 40 people in that segment. They were mostly disheartened or simply walking the course out. I was gasping for my dear life after every high-intensity cycle.

Hi, I'm Tiago!

I'm currently building [digital products][1] people use everyday at [Work & Co][2].
In my free time I'm an avid [distance runner][3], [open source][4] supporter, and
[board game][5] enthusiast. My passion is bridging business and technology. I'm a
[software engineer][6] at heart and [businessperson by training][7]. In my past life I
was a technologist at [Digitalist][9] (Finland), where I oversaw large-scale technical
projects and ramped up R&D centers in Beijing and Chengdu (China). I'm an alum of
[Columbia University][10], [London Business School][11], and [Unicamp][12] (Brazil)
where I received my MBAs and MSc respectively.

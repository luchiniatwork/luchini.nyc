# Hi, I'm Tiago!

I build meaningful [digital products][1] people use everyday. My
passion is bridging business and technology.

I'm a [software engineer][6] at heart and [businessperson by training][7].

In my past life I was Partner at [Work & Co][2] (USA), a technologist
at [Digitalist][9] (Finland), a Sr. Executive for [Nokia][13], where I
oversaw large-scale technical projects and ramped up R&D centers in
Beijing and Chengdu (China), and a CTO/Entrepreneur in Brazil.

I'm an alum of [Columbia University][10] (USA), [London Business School][11]
(UK), and [Unicamp][12] (Brazil) where I received my MBAs
and MSc respectively.

In my free time I'm an avid [distance runner][3], [open source][4]
supporter, and [board game][5] enthusiast.
